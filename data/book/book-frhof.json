Karlach, one of the heroes of {@i Baldur's Gate 3}, has a magical {@i Infernal Engine} for a heart, which grants her incredible power but brings unusual, life-threatening complications.

For example, a merchant who gives daily obeisance to Waukeen, the god of trade, might offer up a propitiatory prayer to Umberlee, god of the sea, when faced with a long and difficult voyage.",

Are you\u2014or do you aspire to become\u2014one of your god's Chosen?",

For example, a character that reveres Chauntea or Mielikki might despise Malar, a god of the hunt, or Auril, a god of winter, both of which represent nature in an evil, destructive form. Or you might carry a special enmity toward one of Malar's Chosen.",

Even if you're making a character that doesn't cast spells, magic might have affected your character's life, their family, or their occupation.

In these places, long-lost treasures await intrepid adventurers.",

Its meaning has since expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, such as the magic keeping the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril afloat, the wards of Silverymoon, and the smaller workings of magic that keep safe important locations like Candlekeep. Some even consider the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain beneath Waterdeep a mythal.",

Mythals can sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return.",

Although an {@spell Identify|XPHB} spell might reveal some of a mythal's simplest effects, spellcasters can discover spellcasting restrictions only by trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal without assistance, but such feats are rarely attempted by even the most renowned mages. Any elven city with \"Myth\" in its name (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has or had a mythal.

Dunstan is assisted and advised by the spirit of Eldenser, whose incorporeal form dwells inside Dunstan's magic sword. Because Dunstan doesn't have a living amethyst dragon partner, he can't travel around Faerûn as easily as other knights can, and his duties keep him at Purplemont, the knights' fortress in Suzail.",
								"The Grand Knight is assisted by a council of twelve High Knights, experienced warriors whose loyalty to Cormyr is beyond question. They lead other knights of Cormyr in battle.",
								"Most Purple Dragon Knights are simply knights, with no other rank. While knights aspire to become High Knights, few ever achieve that rank. Knights might be assigned quests by the Grand Knight or the queen, but between missions they live as knights errant. They travel Cormyr or anywhere their dragon takes them, pursuing justice for the oppressed, protecting the weak, and furthering the goals of Cormyr.",
								"New knights carry the title of knight novice for a year and a day. During this time, they follow the orders of other knights and master the art of riding a dragon.

										"An individual who wants to join the Purple Dragon Knights\u2014or \"take the purple,\" in Cormyrean parlance\u2014must get the attention of a knight and ask to become the knight's squire. For citizens of Cormyr, this is relatively easy; an aspiring squire who goes to Purplemont in Suzail can usually attract a knight's attention in short order. But the legend of the Purple Dragon Knights has spread far and wide in recent years, and people from Icewind Dale to Calimshan dream of riding an amethyst dragon across Faerûnian skies. For these people, finding a knight can be a significant quest.",
										"Knights decide who to take as a squire. Most knights expect a squire to demonstrate fighting skill, courage, a willingness to follow orders, and a keen sense of right and wrong. More eager candidates exist than there are amethyst dragons, so knights select only the best to become squires. Since it's considered bad luck to accept a squire who has already been refused by another knight, few aspirants continue their quest for knighthood after facing rejection.",
										"Squires usually train for a few years before they're made a knight, but proving their courage, skill, and character in extraordinary circumstances can expedite their knighthood. But before a squire can become a Purple Dragon Knight, an amethyst dragon must choose the squire as its rider. Not every squire is chosen, and squires passed over by a dragon often get discouraged and quit their pursuit of knighthood. Others stick it out, continuing to serve the Purple Dragon Knights as squires or administrators in hopes to be chosen as a dragon's rider one day."

										"Amethyst dragons are exceptionally powerful. A Purple Dragon Knight is usually far less formidable than the dragon they ride. But a dragon's rider has courage, ambition, and hope\u2014qualities admired by amethyst dragons. The best pairings strategically leverage their strengths and weaknesses. Against an especially dangerous enemy, a knight is apt to let the dragon take point. When a situation calls for diplomacy and a dragon might be seen as a threat, the knight leads.",

For example, because amethyst dragons can breathe underwater and swim at great speed, many knights make temporary camps in undersea grottoes or in hidden pools accessible only by flooded tunnels. The Grand Knight even built a secret sanctuary for the knights in the Dragonmere, a small sea on Cormyr's southern coast."

								"The Waterclock Guild was a group of artificers, geomancers, and artisans based out of Neverwinter. The guild's members were responsible for crafting that city's once-famous waterclocks: beautiful, incredibly accurate timekeeping devices powered by the flow of water and\u2014unknown to many\u2014elemental magic.",
								"Although the guild proper ceased operation long ago, vestiges of its works still litter forgotten crypts and abandoned ruins in Neverwinter. Recently, traveling gnome and dwarf crafters arrived in Neverwinter in search of the Waterclock Guild's lost inventions. These crafters claimed to be guild members returning from a centuries-long sojourn, and they sought to recover their fellows' relics so they could restore the guild and continue its work. Their labor is still underway, but the project, now known as the Waterclock Renaissance, seems destined for success.",
								"The leaders of the Waterclock Renaissance are eager to bolster their numbers. Even novice clockmakers are being considered for positions in the small organization, as are woodworkers, metallurgists, and spellcasters with an aptitude for the craft and maintenance of clocks.",
